# What is it ?
This script will automatically find the best Warp endpoint IP and place it in your x-ui panel and finally restart the xray core.
After the script has been run, you can choose how many hours it will automatically run and update the Warp endpoint IP.
This script will not interfere with your existing Warp settings.
Please make sure you have a backup of your Warp settings before running this script.
